<p>
The Modelica_StateGraph2 library (called <u>StateGraph2</u> below)
is based on the experience with the current
Modelica.StateGraph library (called <u>StateGraph1</u> below) and is
a significantly further development of StateGraph1. Furthermore, it is heavily
based on the article (Malmheden et. al. 2008), see
<A HREF="Modelica_StateGraph2_UsersGuide.html#Modelica_StateGraph2.UsersGuide.Literature"
>literature</a>,
but uses a different implementation
technique as described in this article. The StateGraph2
library has the following improvements with respect to the StateGraph1
library:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>3 Basic Components (Step, Transition, Parallel)</b><br>
     All multiple versions of a component are
     combined in only one version (e.g., one step and not 4 step components).
     This is easier to understand and more convenient to use.
     The "Parallel" component is both used as "composite step" (so only one branch),
     as well as "parallel step" (so several execution branches).<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li> <b>Conveniently connecting components</b><br>
     Connecting components of a state machine in Modelica means to provide
     new vector dimensions and to provide a vector index to connect to.
     In StateGraph2, the new "connectorSizing" annotation is used and
     therefore all this is now performed automatically (from a users point
     of view, these actions are hidden; this is not the case in
     StateGraph1 and makes the usage of the StateGraph1 library clumsy).<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li> <b>Safer state machines</b><br>
     It is no longer possible to construct a wrong state machine in the sense that properties
     of the graph are violated (e.g. two initial steps, or branching wrongly out of a parallel
     component). Contrary to StateGraph2, in StateGraph1 such wrong graphs do not lead to an
     error but to unexpected simulation results. Still, other desirable properties
     of a state machine,  such as "no deadlock" or "lifeliness" or "every step reachable",
     are not (yet) guaranteed with the current StateGraph2. <br>&nbsp;</li>

<li> <b>Composite, autonomous, synchronized, preempted subgraphs</b><br>
     Composite steps and parallel steps are described in a much better and more powerful
     way as in StateGraph1: Either by component "Parallel" or
     by inheriting from "PartialParallel". The first alternative has the advantage that it
     is simple to use (not necessary to construct a new class and instanciating this class, and
     easy variable access since no new hierarchy is constructed), the second alternative
     has the advantage that it introduces a Modelica hierarchy (useful for large subgraphs).
     In both cases, various options are possible, such as
     <ol>
     <li> autonomous subgraphs (branches are executed in parallel autonomously),  </li>
     <li> synchronized subgraphs (branches are executed in parallel and are synchronized
           before leaving the subgraph via the outPort), </li>
     <li> subgraphs with preemption and exception (a parallel step can be interrupted via
          the suspend ports and can continue execution via the resume ports).</li>
     </ol>
     This is achieved by enabling/disabling the different ports.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> <b>No infinite looping</b>:<br>
     As in StateGraph1, there are two types of transitions: immediate transitions (during event
     iteration all immediate transitions fire until no transition condition is true anymore) and
     delayed transitions (a transition fires only after a delay). Contrary to StateGraph1,
     in StateGraph2 every loop must have at least one delayed transition. If this is not the case
     a translation error occurs which states that the model contains an algebraic loop
     between Booleans with the name "checkOneDelayedTransitionPerLoop".<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This property guarantees that an event
     iteration over a StateGraph2 converges after a
     finite number of iterations, provided the modeller does not introduce an unsafe construct
     in the actions associated with a StateGraph2 (e.g. "i = pre(i) + 1" in the equation section
     outside of a when-clause will give an event iteration that never stops).<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible to switch off this feature, by setting parameter
     "loopCheck = <b>false</b>" in one transition of a loop, instead of using a "delayed transition"
     at this place (in cases where immediate transitions are
     important and the transition conditions are in a form that they cannot fire at the
     same time instant).</li>
</ul>

This library is implemented with the
<a href="http://www.modelica.org/documents/ModelicaSpec31.pdf">Modelica 3.1</a> language.
Additionally, some <u>extensions</u> to the Modelica language are used, in order to
guarantee that only valid StateGraph2 graphs are accepted by a Modelica tool.
It is planned to introduce these new language elements into the <u>next version 3.2</u>
of the Modelica language. This means, only Modelica tools will be able to process
this Modelica_StateGraph2 package, if the following (non-standard)
extensions of Modelica are supported:
</p>

<h4>Connection Graphs for State Diagrams (new section 9.4.2)</h4>
<p>
In order that a Modelica translator can guarantee the connection structure of hierarchical state diagrams, some additional operators are needed for the virtual connection graph. This special virtual connection graph is called &quot;virtual state diagram graph&quot; in the sequel. Virtual state diagram graphs are undirected graphs having overdetermined type or record instances as nodes. The branches are defined by connect(..) and by Connections.branch(..) statements. With the new operators Connections.<b>uniqueRoot</b>(..) and Connections.<b>uniqueRootIndices</b>(..) restrictions to the graph are introduced, as defined in the following table. If one node of a virtual connection graph is marked with uniqueRoot(..), then a virtual state diagram graph is present and it is not allowed to apply the operators Connections.root(..), Connections.potentialRoot, or Connections.isRoot(..) on a node of this graph.
</p>

<ul>
<li> New operator: Connections.<b>uniqueRoot</b>(root, message=&quot;&quot;)<br>
The overdetermined type or record instance &quot;root&quot; is a unique root node in a virtual state diagram graph. Every virtual state diagram graph must have exactly one uniqueRoot(..) definition, before breakable branches are removed. Argument &quot;root&quot; may be a vector. Then, the operator is applied on every element of this vector.
The second argument is a message that shall be reported if the root is not unique. From all uniqueRoot(..) definitions of the same graph, only one of the message arguments shall (arbitrarily) be selected and used in the error message. [<i>The error message should additionally include the path (= instance names) between the unique root definitions. A typical value for message is: &quot;Two or more state diagram graphs are connected that should not be connected&quot;</i>]<br>&nbsp;
</li>

<li> New operator: rootIndices = Connections.<b>uniqueRootIndices</b>(roots, nodes, message=&quot;&quot;)<br>
The two first input arguments are vectors of overdetermined types or record instances with the restriction that size(nodes,1) &le; size(roots,1).
Vector &quot;roots&quot; must contain unique roots in the virtual state diagram graphs. The function returns an Integer vector which is a permuted version of vector &quot;1:size(roots,1)&quot;:
<ul>
<li> rootIndices[i], i = 1,.., size(nodes,1):<br>
     There is a path from roots[rootIndices[i]] to nodes[i].
     It is an error, if such a path does not exist.
     In such a case, the error message should include the third argument &quot;message&quot;.</li>
<li> rootIndices[j], j = size(nodes,1) + 1, ..., size(roots,1):<br>
     There is no path from roots[rootIndices[j]] to an element of nodes[:]. </li>
</ul>
[<i>The typical use is to verify the connection structure of a Parallel component.
Furthermore, it is determined at which entry index a branch starts and at which exit index the branch stops. This information might be used to determine that every &quot;loop&quot;
has at least one delayed transition. Example:</i>
<pre>
  EntryPort entry  [nEntry];
  ExitPort  exit   [nExit];
  Integer   indices[nEntry];
<b>equation</b>
  Connections.uniqueRoot(entry, "...");
  indices = Connections.uniqueRootIndices(entry, exit, "...");
</pre>]
</li>
</ul>

</ol>

<p>
<b>3. Acceptance.</b> Any use of the Original Work or a
Derivative Work, or any action according to either Section 2a) to 2f)
above constitutes Your acceptance of this License.</p>

<p>
<b>4. Designation of Derivative Works and of Modified Works.
</b>The identifying designation of Derivative Work and of Modified
Work must be different to the corresponding identifying designation
of the Original Work. This means especially that the (root-level)
name of a Modelica package under this license must be changed if the
package is modified (besides fixing of errors, adding vendor specific
Modelica annotations, using a subset of the classes of a Modelica
package, or using another representation, e.g. a binary
representation).</p>

<p>
<b>5. Grant of Patent License.</b>
Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license,
under patent claims owned by the Licensor or licensed to the Licensor by
the owners of the Original Work that are embodied in the Original Work
as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents,
to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work
and Derivative Works under the conditions as given in Section 2.
For the matter of clarity, the license regarding Derivative Works covers
patent claims to the extent as they are embodied in the Original Work only.</p>

<p>
<b>6. Provision of Source Code.</b> Licensor agrees to provide
You with a copy of the Source Code of the Original Work but reserves
the right to decide freely on the manner of how the Original Work is
provided.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the matter of clarity, Licensor might provide only a binary
representation of the Original Work. In that case, You may (a) either
reproduce the Source Code from the binary representation if this is
possible (e.g., by performing a copy of an encrypted Modelica
package, if encryption allows the copy operation) or (b) request the
Source Code from the Licensor who will provide it to You.</p>

<p>
<b>7. Exclusions from License Grant.</b> Neither the names of
Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor
any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or
promote products derived from this Original Work without express
prior permission of the Licensor. Except as otherwise expressly
stated in this License and in particular in Sections 2 and 5, nothing
in this License grants any license to Licensor&rsquo;s trademarks,
copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual
property, and no patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer
for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No license is granted to the trademarks of
Licensor even if such trademarks are included in the Original Work,
except as expressly stated in this License. Nothing in this License
shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms
different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise
would have a right to license.</p>

<p>
<b>8. Attribution Rights.</b> You must retain in the Source
Code of the Original Work and of any Derivative Works that You
create, all author, copyright, patent, or trademark notices, as well
as any descriptive text identified therein as an &quot;Attribution
Notice&quot;. The same applies to the licensing notice of this
License in the Original Work. For the matter of clarity, &ldquo;author
notice&rdquo; means the notice that identifies the original
author(s). <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative
Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice
reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the
Original Work. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case the Original Work or Derivative Work is not provided in
Source Code, the Attribution Notices shall be appropriately
displayed, e.g., in the documentation of the Derivative Work.</p>

<p><b>9. Disclaimer
of Warranty. <br></b><u><b>The Original Work is provided under this
License on an &quot;as is&quot; basis and without warranty, either
express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of
non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular
purpose. The entire risk as to the quality of the Original Work is
with You.</b></u><b> </b>This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an
essential part of this License. No license to the Original Work is
granted by this License except under this disclaimer.</p>

<p>
<b>10. Limitation of Liability.</b> Under no circumstances and
under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor, the owner or a licensee
of the Original Work be liable to anyone for any direct, indirect,
general, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character arising as a result of this License or the use of the
Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability
shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such
limitation.</p>

<p>
<b>11. Termination.</b> This License conditions your rights to
undertake the activities listed in Section 2 and 5, including your
right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and
doing so without observing these terms and conditions is prohibited
by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is
intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations. This License
shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the
rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to observe
the conditions of this license.</p>

<p>
<b>12. Termination for Patent Action.</b> This License shall
terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the
rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an
action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor,
any owners of the Original Work or any licensee alleging that the
Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall
not apply for an action alleging patent infringement through
combinations of the Original Work under combination with other
software or hardware.</p>

<p>
<b>13. Jurisdiction.</b> Any action or suit relating to this
License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein
the Licensor resides and under the laws of that jurisdiction
excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the
scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to
the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the
appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination
of this License.</p>

<p>
<b>14. Attorneys&rsquo; Fees.</b> In any action to enforce the
terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs
incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such
action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.</p>

<p>
<b>15. Miscellaneous.</b>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>If any
	provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
	provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
	enforceable.</li>

	<li>No verbal
	ancillary agreements have been made. Changes and additions to this
	License must appear in writing to be valid. This also applies to
	changing the clause pertaining to written form.</li>

	<li>You may use the
	Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by
	this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with
	or be responsible for such uses by You.</li>

Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
<p>This
section contains questions/answer to users and/or distributors of
Modelica packages and/or documents under Modelica License 2. Note,
the answers to the questions below are not a legal interpretation of
the Modelica License 2. In case of a conflict, the language of the
license shall prevail.</p>

<p><b>What are the main
differences to the previous version of the Modelica License?</b></p>
<ol>
	<li><p>
	Modelica License 1 is unclear whether the licensed Modelica package
	can be distributed under a different license. Version 2 explicitly
	allows that &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo; can be distributed under
	any license of Your choice, see examples in Section 1d) as to what
	qualifies as Derivative Work (so, version 2 is clearer).</p>
	<li><p>
	If You modify a Modelica package under Modelica License 2 (besides
	fixing of errors, adding vendor specific Modelica annotations, using
	a subset of the classes of a Modelica package, or using another
	representation, e.g., a binary representation), you must rename the
	root-level name of the package for your distribution. In version 1
	you could keep the name (so, version 2 is more restrictive). The
	reason of this restriction is to reduce the risk that Modelica
	packages are available that have identical names, but different
	functionality.</p>
	<li><p>
	Modelica License 1 states that &ldquo;It is not allowed to charge a
	fee for the original version or a modified version of the software,
	besides a reasonable fee for distribution and support<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&ldquo;.
	Version 2 has a </SPAN>similar intention for all Original Work under
	<u>Modelica License 2</u> (to remain free of charge and open source)
	but states this more clearly as &ldquo;No fee, neither as a
	copyright-license fee, nor as a selling fee for the copy as such may
	be charged&rdquo;. Contrary to version 1, Modelica License 2 has no
	restrictions on fees for Derivative Work that is provided under a
	different license (so, version 2 is clearer and has fewer
	restrictions).</p>
	<li><p>
	Modelica License 2 introduces several useful provisions for the
	licensee (articles 5, 6, 12), and for the licensor (articles 7, 12,
	13, 14) that have no counter part in version 1.</p>
	<li><p>
	Modelica License 2 can be applied to all type of work, including
	documents, images and data files, contrary to version 1 that was
	dedicated for software only (so, version 2 is more general).</p>
</ol>

<p><b>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) as part of my commercial
Modelica modeling and simulation environment?</b></p>
<p>Yes,
according to Section 2c). However, you are not allowed to charge a
fee for this part of your environment. Of course, you can charge for
your part of the environment.
</p>

<p><b>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) under a different
license?</b></p>
<p>No.
The license of an unmodified Modelica package cannot be changed
according to Sections 2c) and 2d). This means that you cannot <u>sell</u>
copies of it, any distribution has to be free of charge.</p>

<p><b>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) under a different license
when I first encrypt the package?</b></p>
<p>No.
Merely encrypting a package does not qualify for Derivative Work and
therefore the encrypted package has to stay under Modelica License 2.</p>

<p><b>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) under a different license
when I first add classes to the package?</b></p>
<p>No.
The package itself remains unmodified, i.e., it is Original Work, and
therefore the license for this part must remain under Modelica
License 2. The newly added classes can be, however, under a different
license.
</p>

<p><b>Can
I copy a class out of a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2)
and include it </b><u><b>unmodified</b></u><b> in a Modelica package
under a </b><u><b>commercial/proprietary license</b></u><b>?</b></p>
<p>No,
according to article 2c). However, you can include model, block,
function, package, record and connector classes in your Modelica
package under <u>Modelica License 2</u>. This means that your
Modelica package could be under a commercial/proprietary license, but
one or more classes of it are under Modelica License 2.<br>Note, a
&ldquo;type&rdquo; class (e.g., type Angle = Real(unit=&rdquo;rad&rdquo;))
can be copied and included unmodified under a commercial/proprietary
license (for details, see the next question).</p>

<p><b>Can
I copy a type class or </b><u><b>part</b></u><b> of a model, block,
function, record, connector class, out of a Modelica package (under
Modelica License 2) and include it modified or unmodified in a
Modelica package under a </b><u><b>commercial/proprietary</b></u><b>
license</b></p>
<p>Yes,
according to article 2d), since this will in the end usually qualify
as Derivative Work. The reasoning is the following: A type class or
part of another class (e.g., an equation, a declaration, part of a
class description) cannot be utilized &ldquo;by its own&rdquo;. In
order to make this &ldquo;usable&rdquo;, you have to add additional
code in order that the class can be utilized. This is therefore
usually Derivative Work and Derivative Work can be provided under a
different license. Note, this only holds, if the additional code
introduced is sufficient to qualify for Derivative Work. Merely, just
copying a class and changing, say, one character in the documentation
of this class would be no Derivative Work and therefore the copied
code would have to stay under Modelica License 2.</p>

<p><b>Can
I copy a class out of a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2)
and include it in </b><u><b>modified </b></u><b>form in a
</b><u><b>commercial/proprietary</b></u><b> Modelica package?</b></p>
<p>Yes.
If the modification can be seen as a &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo;,
you can place it under your commercial/proprietary license. If the
modification does not qualify as &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo; (e.g.,
bug fixes, vendor specific annotations), it must remain under
Modelica License 2. This means that your Modelica package could be
under a commercial/proprietary license, but one or more parts of it
are under Modelica License 2.</p>

<p><b>Can I distribute a
&ldquo;save total model&rdquo; under my commercial/proprietary
license, even if classes under Modelica License 2 are included?</b></p>
<p>Your
classes of the &ldquo;save total model&rdquo; can be distributed
under your commercial/proprietary license, but the classes under
Modelica License 2 must remain under Modelica License 2. This means
you can distribute a &ldquo;save total model&rdquo;, but some parts
might be under Modelica License 2.</p>

<p><b>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) in encrypted form?</b></p>
<p>Yes.
Note, if the encryption does not allow &ldquo;copying&rdquo; of
classes (in to unencrypted Modelica source code), you have to send
the Modelica source code of this package to your customer, if he/she
wishes it, according to article&nbsp;6.</p>

<p><b>Can I distribute an
executable under my commercial/proprietary license, if the model from
which the executable is generated uses models from a Modelica package
under Modelica License 2?</b></p>
<p>Yes,
according to article 2d), since this is seen as Derivative Work. The
reasoning is the following: An executable allows the simulation of a
concrete model, whereas models from a Modelica package (without
pre-processing, translation, tool run-time library) are not able to
be simulated without tool support. By the processing of the tool and
by its run-time libraries, significant new functionality is added (a
model can be simulated whereas previously it could not be simulated)
and functionality available in the package is removed (e.g., to build
up a new model by dragging components of the package is no longer
possible with the executable).</p>

<p><b>Is my modification to
a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) a Derivative Work?</b></p>
<p>It
is not possible to give a general answer to it. To be regarded as &quot;an
original work of authorship&quot;, a derivative work must be
different enough from the original or must contain a substantial
amount of new material. Making minor changes or additions of little
substance to a preexisting work will not qualify the work as a new
version for such purposes.

<p>This
section is devoted especially for the following applications:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>
	A Modelica tool extracts information out of a Modelica package and
	presents the result in form of a &ldquo;manual&rdquo; for this
	package in, e.g., html, doc, or pdf format.</p>
	<li><p>
	The Modelica language specification is a document defining the
	Modelica language. It will be licensed under Modelica License 2.</p>
	<li><p>
	Someone writes a book about the Modelica language and/or Modelica
	packages and uses information which is available in the Modelica
	language specification and/or the corresponding Modelica package.</p>
</ol>

<p><b>Can I sell a manual
that was basically derived by extracting information automatically
from a Modelica package under Modelica License 2 (e.g., a &ldquo;reference
guide&rdquo; of the Modelica Standard Library):</b></p>
<p>Yes.
Extracting information from a Modelica package, and providing it in a
human readable, suitable format, like html, doc or pdf format, where
the content is significantly modified (e.g. tables with interface
information are constructed from the declarations of the public
variables) qualifies as Derivative Work and there are no restrictions
to charge a fee for Derivative Work under alternative 2d).</p>

<p><b>Can
I copy a text passage out of a Modelica document (under Modelica
License 2) and use it </b><u><b>unmodified</b></u><b> in my document
(e.g. the Modelica syntax description in the Modelica Specification)?</b></p>
<p>Yes.
In case you distribute your document, the copied parts are still
under Modelica License 2 and you are not allowed to charge a license
fee for this part. You can, of course, charge a fee for the rest of
your document.</p>

<p><b>Can
I copy a text passage out of a Modelica document (under Modelica
License 2) and use it in </b><u><b>modified</b></u><b> form in my
document?</b></p>
<p>Yes,
the creation of Derivative Works is allowed. In case the content is
significantly modified this qualifies as Derivative Work and there
are no restrictions to charge a fee for Derivative Work under
alternative 2d).</p>

<p><b>Can I sell a printed
version of a Modelica document (under Modelica License 2), e.g., the
Modelica Language Specification?</b></p>
<p>No,
if you are not the copyright-holder, since article 2c) does not allow
a selling fee for a (in this case physical) copy. However, mere
printing and shipping costs may be recovered.</p>

<p>
This library is based on the Modelica.StateGraph library and
therefore the acknowledgement of the StateGraph library is repeated here:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The development of the StateGraph was strongly motivated by the
     master thesis of Isolde Dressler
     (<A HREF="Modelica_StateGraph2_UsersGuide.html#Modelica_StateGraph2.UsersGuide.Literature"
>see literature</a>),
     in which
     a compiler from JGrafChart to Modelica was designed and
     implemented. This project was supervised by Karl-Erik Arzen
     from Departement of Automatic Control, Lund Institut of
     Technology, Lund, Sweden.</li>
<li> The StateGraph library profits also from the experience gained
     in the focused research program (Schwerpunktprogramm)
     "Continuous-Discrete Dynamic Systems" (KONDISK), sponsored by the
     Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft under grants OT174/1-2 and EN152/22-2.
     This support is most gratefully acknowledged.
 </li>
<li> The implementation of the basic components of the StateGraph library by describing
     finite state machines with equations is based on
     (Elmqvist, Mattsson and Otter, 2001),
     which in turn uses ideas from (Mosterman, Otter and Elmqvist, 1998),
     see <A HREF="Modelica_StateGraph2_UsersGuide.html#Modelica_StateGraph2.UsersGuide.Literature"
>literature</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The Modelica_StateGraph2 library is based on further ideas developed in
(Malmheden et.al., 2008),
     see <A HREF="Modelica_StateGraph2_UsersGuide.html#Modelica_StateGraph2.UsersGuide.Literature"
>literature</a>,
and the prototype ModeGraph library developed by Martin Malmheden during
his master thesis and for this article.
